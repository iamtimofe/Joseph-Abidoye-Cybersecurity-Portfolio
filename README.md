## 👨🏽‍💻 About Me

I began my cybersecurity journey in November 2025 at AltSchool Africa, focusing on building strong foundations in networking, Linux systems, and security operations.

My learning approach is hands-on and lab-driven, with emphasis on understanding how networks function, how access is controlled, and how security policies are enforced.

My long-term goal is to become a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst specializing in threat detection, monitoring, and incident response.
