## 👨🏽‍💻 About Me

I began my cybersecurity journey in November 2025 at AltSchool Africa, focusing on building strong practical foundations in network security, Linux systems, and security operations.

Through hands-on lab simulations and structured learning, I have developed practical experience in:

- Network segmentation (VLAN implementation)
- Inter-VLAN routing (Router-on-a-Stick)
- Access Control List (ACL) design and enforcement
- Linux system configuration and networking
- Security validation through testing and troubleshooting

My long-term goal is to become a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst specializing in threat detection, monitoring, and incident response.

## 🚀 Featured Project

### 📡 Secure Branch Office Network Design (VLAN + ACL Implementation)

This project demonstrates the practical implementation of enterprise-style network segmentation and access control using Cisco Packet Tracer.

Key Components Implemented:

- VLAN segmentation for Admin, Sales, and IT departments
- Inter-VLAN routing using Router-on-a-Stick
- Trunk port configuration
- ACL enforcement based on business security requirements
- Ping-based validation testing
- Visual topology documentation

This project showcases structured security design, CLI configuration skills, and policy enforcement validation.
